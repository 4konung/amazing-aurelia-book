# Getting started

In this book I have decided to stick with TypeScript and use Webpack as the package manager and application builder.

Most if not all apps dicsussed will be using these technologies. Furthermore we will leverage [aurelia CLI](https://github.com/aurelia/cli) wherever possible.

## Installing TypeScript

Just go to the [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) site and follow install instructions.

`npm install -g typescript`

## Installing CLI

We will start by installing
