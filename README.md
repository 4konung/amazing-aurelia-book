# Awesome Aurelia application recipes

This book is written as a response to my own experience getting to grips with the new Aurelia web application framework.

I followed the development of Aurelia since it's early days but always found it hard to get started. When it finally reached the 1.0 milestone I thought by now it must be ready for primetime but I found the documentation still sparse and lacking on how to build real apps with the framework. As is all too often the case, all the examples and sample apps were of the Skeleton type, not diving into the meat of the beast.

This book will try to dive into the meat, heart and bones of the framework in order to show you how to write real world next generation apps that can scale. Divide and conquer.
